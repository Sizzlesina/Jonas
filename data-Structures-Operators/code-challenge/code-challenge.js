// << Coding Challenge #4 >>

/* 
Write a program that receives a list of variable
names written in underscore_case and convert them to
camelCase.

The input will come from a textarea inserted into the
DOM (see code below), and conversion will happen when
the button is pressed.


THIS TEST DATA (pasted to textarea)
Underscore_case
  first_name
Some_variable
  calculate_AGE
delayed_departure


SHOULD PRODUCE THIS OUTPUT (5 seprate console.log outputs)

underscoreCase    âœ…
firstName         âœ…âœ…
someVariable      âœ…âœ…âœ…
calculateAge      âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…
delayedDeparture  âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…


HINT 1 : Remember which character defines a new line
in the textarea ðŸ˜‰

HINT 2 : The solution only needs to work for a 
variable made out of 2 words, like a_b

HINT 3 : Start without worrying about the âœ…. Tackle 
that only after you have the variable name conversion
working ðŸ˜‰.

HINT 4 : This challenge is difficult on purpose, so
start watching the solution in case you're stuck.
Then pause and continue!

Afterwards, test with your own test data!

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜‰
